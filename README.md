# Console-Mini-Games
This holds code for various games that can be played by copying and pasting into almost any IDE. MY personal favorite is https://www.onlinegdb.com/ but others work too depending on the amount of charecters allowed on the screen. I'm pretty new to Github so if you are able to edit this, go ahead. If not then please try to explain to me how it works.
